js canvas game
==============

little game framework with javascript and canvas.

Canvas to draw the elemets of your game, and JavaScript to do some action.
Start with the a minimum of code, keyboard, mouse, touch and an animation loop is all we need.

 * objects can draw (no image handle, yet)
 * keycodes to define a keypress event
 * mouseclick return a position
 * touch (one finger now) return the position
 * FPS count (canvas can be very slow)
